### IDA sucks

IDA is full of bugs and the support doesn't want to fix them or ignore us. We use it because we have to, because we don't have any good alternative (yet... Hopper, Binary Ninja, Relyze, Medusa etc. are coming).

It's time to concentrate our rage to make hex-rays listen to us and to share our fixes to make IDA suck less.

Feel free to share your experience / fixes!
